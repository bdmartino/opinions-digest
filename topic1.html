                    <h3>If they wanted to, they would have.</h3>
                    <p>It’s been widely accepted that Iran has had the capability to make the Nuclear bomb for last decade. The reason that they have not till now is that they understand that the global backlash from possessing nuclear weaponry without being officially recognized as a nuclear state would outweigh the defensive benefits of owning the weapon. Iran ia aware that the likeliness of a nuclear bomb being used in today’s world is next to none. Therefore the country’s politicians believe the simply symbolic show of strength is not worth invoking subsequent global and unanimous opposition.

                      A more advanced uranium enrichment system is needed to make sufficient enriched uranium for nuclear power than a nuclear bomb. Iran has been operating a nuclear power plant for 4 years.

                    <h3>Unstable politics, unstable promises</h3>
                    <p>While Iran’s current president, Hassan Rouhani, has often dismissed his country’s nuclear weaponry intentions, hardliners within Iran’s political hierarchy have often called for the weapons to be made. With the unstable political climate in Iran as well as the surrounding middle eastern countries, Rouhani is not guaranteed control of the country and so its nuclear programme. There have been several rumours of imminent insurgencies in the country so Rouhani’s promise to not make the bomb, while trustable, might well be irrelevant soon.

                    <h3>Deal hinders Iran’s path to the bomb.</h3>
                    <p>At the current rate at which Iran is already developing its nuclear program, this deal can only hinder their progress. In truth, Iran have had the resources and intelligence to make a nuclear weapon for the past eight years. This deal forces Iran to cap its centrifuges at very low levels, keep enrichment levels well below those that could be used for weapons and convert its existing enriched uranium into fuel rods (which could not be put to military use).  Iran is looking to be accepted as a nuclear state and are willing to sacrifice the development of their facilities for global acceptance. They are not using this deal to fast-track their path to nuclear weaponry.

                      The proposed deal is rumoured to disallow Iran from developing nuclear weaponry for at least the next 9 years.
