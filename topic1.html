</h3>
                    <p>Rouhani notes that under the constitution, Iranians are entitled to have important issues put to a referendum instead of a parliamentary issue. Realizing that sanctions on Iran have put the country in an extremely difficult economic situation, he is considering a referendum that would make the deal difficult to oppose by hardliners. This suggests that Rouhani’s intentions are to pass the deal.   <br> <a href="#" data-popup=".t1-q4-o4" class="open-popup"> Learn more </a></p>

                      In 2004 Rouhani, while heading the Supreme National Security Council and leading Iran's negotiations with Western powers regarding the nuclear deal, he suggested putting the nuclear programme to public vote.

                    <p>Netanyahu is applying his usual scaremongering tactics to a US congress he knows is heavily against the Obama administration. He is trying to put pressure on Obama by appealing to the Republicans. Something he managed to do successfully judging by the unnecessary amount of clapping exhibited in the House of Representatives. <br> <a href="#" data-popup=".t1-q5-o1" class="open-popup"> Learn more </a></p>

                    <p>Netanyahu used this opportunity to embarrass the President hoping it would undermine Obama’s efforts to reach a deal with Iran. By being invited by a speaker of the Congress as opposed to the president and then riddling his speech with digs at Obama, Netanyahu wants to show supporters and opposition that he is not being silenced by the US.  <br> <a href="#" data-popup=".t1-q5-o2" class="open-popup"> Learn more </a></p>

                    <p>The reason for speaking in Congress was not an opportunity for Netanyahu to insult the US President. Instead, he wanted to warn the world of what he truly believes is a grave mistake by passing this weak deal. He is adamant that Iran’s nuclear ambitions are malicious. He wanted to share these concerns on the biggest stage.
