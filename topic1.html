                    <h3>If they wanted to, they would have</h3>
                    <p>It’s been widely accepted that Iran has had the capability to make the Nuclear bomb for last decade. The reason that they have not till now is that they understand that the global backlash from possessing nuclear weaponry without being officially recognized as a nuclear state would outweigh the defensive benefits of owning the weapon. Iran ia aware that the likeliness of a nuclear bomb being used in today’s world is next to none. Therefore the country’s politicians believe the simply symbolic show of strength is not worth invoking subsequent global and unanimous opposition.

                      A more advanced uranium enrichment system is needed to make sufficient enriched uranium for nuclear power than a nuclear bomb. Iran has been operating a nuclear power plant for 4 years.

                    <p>While Iran’s current president, Hassan Rouhani, has often dismissed his country’s nuclear weaponry intentions, hardliners within Iran’s political hierarchy have often called for the weapons to be made. With the unstable political climate in Iran as well as the surrounding middle eastern countries, Rouhani is not guaranteed control of the country and so its nuclear programme. There have been several rumours of imminent insurgencies in the country so Rouhani’s promise to not make the bomb, while trustable, might well be irrelevant soon.

                    <p>At the current rate at which Iran is already developing its nuclear program, this deal can only hinder their progress. In truth, Iran have had the resources and intelligence to make a nuclear weapon for the past eight years. This deal forces Iran to cap its centrifuges at very low levels, keep enrichment levels well below those that could be used for weapons and convert its existing enriched uranium into fuel rods (which could not be put to military use).  Iran is looking to be accepted as a nuclear state and are willing to sacrifice the development of their facilities for global acceptance. They are not using this deal to fast-track their path to nuclear weaponry.

                    <p>Hassan Rouhani was elected in 2013 in hopes of de-escalating tensions with the West by reaching a comprehensive nuclear deal that would remove international sanctions against Iran. He claims that atomic weapons have not kept nuclear states safe and as such, Iran is not seeking the bomb. Rouhani did not only run as a moderate but headed a delegation that formulated a comprehensive plan to de-escalate tensions with the West and increase confidence in Iran -- in the hope of bringing nuclear energy and not weapons to Iran.

IAEA official Heinonen, who has a long record of dealing with Iranian leaders, claims that Rouhani boasted of how he used talks with the West to “buy time to advance Iran’s programme.” As negotiations draw longer, it seems that the deal is not being implemented in good faith and that Iran is playing games.

Although Zarif denies these claims, a failed deal would supposedly empower Iran’s conservative hardliners, who are part of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, and decrease the chances of Iran’s nuclear program being curbed. In fact, the country is split in their opinion of the nuclear weapons program. As a result, Rouhani is pushing this deal forward.

                    <p>Iran and its government’s recurring links to Hezbollah serve as a red flag for nuclear help to ever be provided to Iran. Just last week, an Israeli investigation on an infiltrated Hezbollah base revealed that army generals had been sharing intelligence with the Hezbollah hierarchy. This coincides with Iran’s increasing state of economic turmoil since the plummet of oil prices. Being able to sell nuclear weaponry will certainly offset that. Giving nuclear resources such as enriched uranium and weapons grade plutonium to Iran is akin to giving nuclear weaponry to Hezbollah. Iran’s access to such materials raises the threat level.

                    <p>Iran has come to the table with proposed nuclear deals several times in past decades. Past rejections were motivated by the thought that Iran could not progress as a non-recognised nuclear state. This was repeatedly proved wrong. Iran’s nuclear program has domestically been one of their few points of pride and a further rejection will simply lead to further unconstrained development. However, today they are capable of developing a nuclear weapon. This would fuel Iran’s very public conflict with Israel.

It is Israel's supposed nuclear arsenal, not Iran's desire for one, that has contributed most to the current crisis.
