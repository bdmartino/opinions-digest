Hamas are relying on the world perceiving Israel as a military powerhouse bullying a defenseless Palestine to pressurise Israel into accepting Palestine’s political demands regarding the territory disputes that have plagued their history. <a href="#" data-popup=".t1-q1-o1" class="open-popup"> Learn more </a></p>
